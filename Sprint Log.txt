	Outline what I need DailyAblutions to do

-Design Document
	Outline how I'm building DailyAblutions

-Get clear with App Store review guidelines (see reading list in Safari)
	Questions:
		Apple Developer Program?
		Human Interface Guidelines?
		Universal apps?
		Sandboxing?
		Are mantra apps too saturated?
		Will my app be likely to be rejected for dependency on notifications?

	All other concerns about the App Store seem settled

Don't neglect AGILE methodology
-Weekly Sprints


Week 1 Sprint
-Build the mantra and task list screen
	-need sample strings
-Build tests for the Mantra and Task classes


Week 2 Sprint
Reflection: I almost got the tests written. Task class revised - it will not be included unless I find a good reason for it later. The Mantra and Task screens are almost done, but still require sample strings and a page view to render them.
Updated goals:
- Finish the page view
- Get sample strings
- Finish the decode init test
- Get the app running, swiping between the catch up, mantra, and task views showing preloaded dummy data


Week 3 Sprint
Reflection: I found new requirements and worked on getting the page view to render non homogeneous strings. This was a difficult week of self-discovery, so nothing else related to the app was accomplished
Updated goals:
- Get the page view to render non-homogeneous views
- Get sample strings to finish the page view
- Finish outlining the new requirements
- Finish the decode init test for Mantra
- Get the app running, swiping between the catch up, mantra, and task views showing preloaded dummy data
