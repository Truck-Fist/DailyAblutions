-Get clear with App Store review guidelines (see reading list in Safari)
	Questions:
		Apple Developer Program?
		Human Interface Guidelines?
		Universal apps?
		Sandboxing?
		Are mantra apps too saturated?
		Will my app be likely to be rejected for dependency on notifications?

	All other concerns about the App Store seem settled

-Weekly Sprints


Week 1 Sprint
-Build the mantra and task list screen
	-need sample strings
-Build tests for the Mantra and Task classes


Week 2 Sprint
Reflection: I almost got the tests written. Task class revised - it will not be included unless I find a good reason for it later. The Mantra and Task screens are almost done, but still require sample strings and a page view to render them.
Updated goals:
- Finish the page view
- Get sample strings
- Finish the decode init test
- Get the app running, swiping between the catch up, mantra, and task views showing preloaded dummy data
